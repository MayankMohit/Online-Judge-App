# Code Junkie – Full-Stack Online Judge😍🧑‍💻

Code Junkie is a full-stack MERN-based online judge platform with real-time code execution, admin dashboard, and user management. It supports Dockerized microservices and HTTPS deployment with custom domain support.

## Features

📩 User Authentication with email verification (via Resend)

💻 Run & Submit Code in multiple languages via compiler microservice

🛠️ Admin Dashboard for managing problems, users, and submissions

📝 Add/Edit/Delete Problems with test cases and tags

📊 User Performance Charts and submission history

🛡️ Role-Based Access Control (admin/user)

💾 Code Persistence: Auto-saves user code per problem even after refresh

🚫 Rate Limiting on compile and auth endpoints to prevent abuse

📱 Fully Responsive Layout for all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

🐳 Docker-Based Microservices with production-ready deployment

🔒 Live Deployment with HTTPS via Railway (automatic TLS)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Railway account (for cloud deployment) or local machine with Docker and Docker Compose
- MongoDB Atlas cluster  
- (Optional) Custom domain for Railway deployment

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MayankMohit/Online-Judge-App.git
cd Online-Judge-App
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create `.env` files for each service:

#### backend/.env

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_KEY=your_jwt_secret
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_key
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
COMPILER_URL=http://localhost:5001
```

#### frontend/.env

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
# For production, use your Railway domain or custom domain:
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

#### compiler-service/.env

```env
PORT=5001
```

### 3. Build and Start Services (Local)

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### 4. Deploy to Railway

Railway automatically handles HTTPS and TLS for all deployments.

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Create a new Railway project and connect your repository
3. Add each service (backend, frontend, compiler-service) as a separate Railway service
4. Set environment variables for each service via the Railway dashboard
5. (Optional) Add a custom domain under **Settings → Domains** — Railway provisions HTTPS automatically

## Development Setup

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Compiler Service

```bash
cd compiler-service
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Admin Access

To make a user an admin, update their role via dashboard or in the database:

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "admin"
}
```


## Roadmap

### 🤖 AI Integration
- **Tiered AI Hints**: Contextual hints (basic → advanced) using problem embeddings and solution similarity.
- **Code Feedback**: LLM-generated feedback after submission — complexity, patterns, anti-patterns, and trade-offs.
- **Bug Detection Assistant**: "Why is my code wrong?" feature with code analysis and test case comparison.
- **AI Code Review**: Automated feedback on readability, modularity, naming, and scoring out of 10.
- **Explain in Layman Terms**: AI-generated problem explanations with analogies, diagrams, and multilingual support.
- **Smart Test Case Generation**: GPT-assisted test case suggestions for problem setters.
- **Plagiarism Detection**: AI-based similarity check between users' submissions.

### 🏆 Competitive Features
- **Contests**: Host and manage timed contests with live leaderboards and real-time feedback.

### 📈 Future Enhancements
- **Performance Visualization**: Execution trade-off diagrams (radar charts, trees).
- **Submission Insights**: Comparative analysis of multiple approaches for a single problem.
